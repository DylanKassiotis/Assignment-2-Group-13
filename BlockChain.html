    <h2>What does it do?</h2>
    <p>“A blockchain is a type of decentralized database system based on linking together previous records in secure blocks of information”. (Dicionary.com).</p>
    <br>
    <p>An important definition of blockchain as it is a simple idea that is most commonly known in popular culture today as being synonymous with crypto currencies. Blockchain, however, is the technology, or concept, of secure data processing and
      storage in a decentralised environment. Decentralised means that there is no single repository of data storage, or traffic control in a server, or in the case of currency, a bank. This allows for peer to peer data transactions without
      regulation.</p>

    <p>The blockchain is an amount of saved data across a network of individual users and is unalterable. The reason it is unalterable is that once a data transaction is made it remains in the memory of all the users in the system. For example, a
      permanent record of every Bitcoin transaction is available to anyone who would access the network at any time. If any alteration is made to the data history it is compared with countless other ledgers across the system and would be rejected as
      it does not conform to the consensus. The data is secured because everyone has a copy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Taking the example of the Bitcoin blockchain, the blockchain is approximately 320GB as of the 17th of January 20221 according to Blockchain.com:</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>Blockchain is distributed across its network, which means individual PCs of users. This is too much data, data that is growing exponentially, for one computer to reasonably hold. Ie, a copy of the entire chain as the ledger on every computer
      in the network is not practical and this holds the same other uses of the blockchain in all applications.<br><br>
      The record is divided in data blocks and each repository holds one block and the previous block before it. This may vary depending on the size of the blocks and the network. Sheregen.com shows a simple version of this as:

    <a href="https://www.spheregen.com/blockchain-technology-basics/">https://www.spheregen.com/blockchain-technology-basics/</a>
    <br>
    <p>Each block will consist of a number of manageable transactions called ‘hashes’. A hash consists of defined amount of data and each block will at least contain the current hash and the previous hash. The current hash is compared to the same
      hash on other systems and when they agree they become part of the block on those systems. All together the blocks fall into a ‘block chain’. <br><br>
      The chain can also fork into separate data sets, such as Bitcoin forking into new currencies: </p>

    <p>The blocks forming the chain are represented well in this diagram. The blocks are pieces of the puzzle that fit together to form the secure chain.</p>

  <div class="What-is-the-likely-impact">
    <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
    <p>Blockchain technology may have first been conceived in 1991 by a paper written by Dr W. Scott Stornetta and Dr Stuart Harber introducing the term ‘blockchain’ as a decentralised, cryptic database where digital transactions are secured.
      (Australian Fin Tech). The first application of the technology was in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin. There have already been important developments using blockchain technology which is open source. This makes it readily available
      to any person or organisation to create their own blockchain. <br><br> In 1991 there were no applications for blockchain. In 2008 it was used to create cryptocurrency and since there have been many more crypto currencies and many more
      applications in use and theorised. <br> </p>
    <p>The ability to record and store information securely across a network is vastly superior to the storage of information in a single, vulnerable source because of the security this affords to the data. Integrity for the data is achieved by
      having the blockchain viewable to anybody with access and commonly, in the case of crypto currency, anyone worldwide with internet access. <br><br>The reliability of data, the ease of transmission without third parties and the integrity of the
      system mean that this is a secure and faster means of processing data, which of course, will only continue to expand in its applications and use. <br> </p>
    <p>A centralised system will come to a halt if the central component is corrupted. This could be computer server affecting the entire network, or a power transformer causing a black out. A decentralised system is not affected when one component
      is compromised. The single compromised component can be repaired while the system carries on. Using blockchain the bank could be collapsed in an earthquake, but the network will continue unaffected for those with a bank account. <br><br>The
      future could potentially be a world without banks or credit card companies charging merchant fees as peer to peer transactions take over. <br> <br>The future could potentially be a world without intermediaries for financial transactions –
      buying and selling property, shares and commodities. </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>The future could potentially be a world with much less litigation, required oversite and much smoother business transactions due to smart contracts. <br><br>The health industry and global planning could be very much improved by automated smart
      contracts facilitating the transfer of resources.<br><br>This is all speculation. The future is all speculation at best. There are many negative aspects to automated technologies and systems, but importantly the blockchain is a technology that
      is important where decentralised, cryptic databases and secure digital transactions are beneficial. </p>

  <div class="How-will-this-affect-you">
    <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>For me personally, I am most excited about blockchain applications in health care. I am thinking large scale in being able to identify outbreaks of disease live and automatically, as well as the day to day operations of having stocks and
      resources automatically inventoried and ordered.<br><br>
      On the large scale the potential is for increased respiratory symptoms being logged in patient record being recognised by a state or national level system that can issue alerts in the earliest stages of a possible pandemic. Imagining PPE,
      isolation equipment and respirators being automatically triggered to be produced and delivered to certain areas by smart contracts would be a game changer for public health.<br><br>
      On the smaller scale, the monitoring of resources, consumables and patient allocations would be an incredible increase to local efficiency. I imagine automated systems delivering consumables to an emergency department before the staff realise
      they are running low because of busy periods. The amount of time and stress saved for health care workers in such places would be immense and reflect on better care for our patients and better health outcomes.<br><br>
      Smart contracts are the most exciting, especially as they apply to health for me. Smart contracts can be written by individuals by adding conditions to a program. In my simple life, this would be a great saving in intermediaries that currently
      facilitate such things, such as a mortgage broker, or a conveyor. <br><br>
      The effect of blockchain cryptocurrencies will be a global phenomenon that will have to wait to be seen. The influx of a tradable commodity with the same power of fiat will create global trends that are out of the control of any authority. It
      will be an interesting time to watch this unfold in future, but I would not ‘guess’ as to whether this will be good or bad for society. <br><br>
