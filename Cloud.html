    <ul>
      <li>Cloud computing does the distribution of various services over the Internet. These resources consist oftools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Instead of keeping documents on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device,cloud-based storagemakes it feasible to save them to a remote database. If an electronic device gain access to the web, it has entry to the data and the
        software programs to operate it.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cloud computing is a popular choice for people and businesses for many reasons as well as cost savings, enhanced productivity, speed and effectiveness, performance, and security</li>
      <br>
      <li>It’s ondemand accessibilityofcomputersystem resources, particularlydata storage (cloud storage) andcomputing power, without immediateactive management by the user. Cloud computing is a renowned and wellrecognizednew technology in which all
        the personal works, data, and all other software be able tobe stored and used in asecure server. It providesthe userindependent and deliveredaccess to the encrypted cloud database. It is split upinto three criteria such as PaaS (Platform as a
        service), Saas (Software as a service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a service). </li>

      <li> Below here, I present a cloud computing architecture by Q. Zhang, Lu Cheng, R. Boutaba
        highlighting its key concepts and architectural principles. The objective of the Cloud Computing
        architecture figure is to offer a better understanding of cloud computing and find important
        research directions in this increasingly valuable area.</li>
      <br>
      <li>The architecture of a cloud computing atmosphere can be split up into 4 layers: the
        hardware/datacenter layer, the infrastructure layer, the platform layer, and the application layer.</li>

    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Cloud computing has newly emerged as a new paradigm for hosting and providing services
        over the Internet. Cloud computing is attractive to business owners like me I am an
        Owner/Diploma Family Day Care Educator in the Child Care industry as it eliminates the
        necessity for users to plan for provisioning and allows business to start from the small and
        increase incomes only when there is a rise in service demand. However, even though cloud
        computing offers huge opportunities to the IT industry, the development of cloud computing
        technology is presently at its infancy, with many issues still to be addressed. </li>
      <br>
      <li>• Everything we need is close to us, which involves accessing our data is fast and easy.
        The cloud is not regarding having dedicated network attached storage (NAS) device in our
        house. Storing data on a home or office network does not count as using the cloud. Though, a
        few NAS devices will allow us remotely access things over the internet, and there's at least one
        brand from Western Digital named "My Cloud," just to keep things confusing.)</li>
      <br>
      <li>For it to be deemed "cloud computing," we require to access our data or our programs over the
        internet, or at the very least, have that data synchronised with additional information over the
        web. In a big business, we might know all there is to know about what is on the other side of
        the connection; as an individual user, we might never have any idea what kind of huge data
        processing is happening on the other end in a data centre that uses more power in a day than
        our entire town does in a year. The result is the same along with an online connection, cloud
        computing can be completed anywhere, anytime.
      </li>
      <br><br>
      <h3 id="brownHeading">What is the likely impact?</h3>
      <li>The likely impact of cloud computing it is the biggest advantage of cost saving. Since everything
        is done online, and we can opt which services we need meaning that we be able to pay only for
        those therefore we will not have to spend a lot of money. There is no requirement to purchase the
        equipment and hire technicians to operate them because everything is done by the provider.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Additionally, this service is available 24/7 which means that we can retrieve the data at any time
        we want to. This is very important if par example my employees at my Child Care travel a lot to
        different countries i.e., time zones and do nearly all their work while on the move.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>This service makes sure the safety of all the information. All data is kept on a cloud which means
        that if some difficulties with our devices occur, we will still be capable to access it. In addition, it is
        protected by numerous passwords meaning that we can choose who gets to see that information.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to this service. First, there is always the
        risk of stealing the data still though it is stored on a remote cloud. Unfortunately, hackers are
        becoming more skilled through each passing day, so the providers must constantly work on
        updating the security features.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Similarly, certain technical issues can occur, and they may affect your work. Regardless of the
        maintenance standards, even the best cloud services provider companies can face this
        challenge.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Lastly, we cannot log into the cloud without an Internet connection. If we find ourselves
        somewhere without Internet access, and we need to see some of the data instantly, this can be
        quite a problem. The same issue can happen if your Internet connection is bad.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>To conclude, even if we have mentioned some disadvantages of using cloud computing, we
        cannot deny that there is more and more business of all sizes and trades that opt for this service.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>The Cloud Computing affect us like me in the Child Care industry by making in our disposition
        Cloud-based childcare software which provides a host of advantages that benefit our operations. </li>
      <br>
      <li>We access the application by the software’s browser-based interface through a secure log-in
        name and password.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>When you access the application, you can work with the software just as you did when the
        program was on your computer.</li>
      <br>
      <li>As we can access the software through a browser, we are freed from our desktop computer. We
        can use any device to access and manage our files and data, any time we want, from anywhere
        we have an internet connection, even a mobile one.</li>
      <br>
      <li> Anytime, anywhere access is one of the biggest advantages of cloud-based childcare software.
        We can use our laptop, smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer without being tied to a particular
        device or location. If we have multiple facilities in operation, we can merge our data processing
        tasks all the way through the cloud-based software, reducing redundancy of work and data.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>With the improvement in mobile networks pushing access speed using to 4G, 5G, and LTE, we
        will have no problems with delays in accessing and working with your software solution.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Updates received to any file or data are finalized in real-time. If we have input data from our office
        computer that comes from a facility in another neighbourhood, city, or state, the changes are
        instantly available to all locations.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>Another advantage of real-time processing is that many users can use the software at the same
        time. Some cloud software applications may handle hundreds or thousands of users at once. </li>
      <br>
      <li>All updates are accessible as soon as they have been made. Cloud-based software makes
        collaboration easy.</li>
      <br>
      <li> We are no longer needed to purchase, install, and maintain IT hardware or software in place.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>We do not require to purchase expensive upgrades and updates.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>The software vendor gives automatic updates when the software needs them. They are part of
        the subscription we pay for every month or every year. The subscription usually includes a set
        amount of service and support from the vendor to assist us with application implementation and
        issues.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>Finally, Cloud computing is something that has been used frequently daily. Any type of online services
      starting from online text editing to listening to music or any other online services it is cloud computing
      projects. It is making life easier by making each service accessible through active internet with ensuring
      strong protection from potential threats. It enhances productivity, reliability with excellent performance,
      and higher security.</p>
