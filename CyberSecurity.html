  <h1>Cybersecurity – By Dylan Kassiotis <br>S3856097</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>What does it do?</h2>
  <p>Ever since the emergence of modern-day technologies in the early seventies, cybersecurity grew in demand as more technologies were invented, so were ways to infiltrate them. To illustrate, Cybersecurity is the art of protecting
    internet-connected systems, networks, and data from unauthorised digital attacks. The former senator of New York Michael Nozzolio states “Just like the locks on our homes protect the very livelihood we hold dear; we must take decisive action to
    protect ourselves and our personal information from the burdensome ramifications of a cyber-attack.” (NOZZOLIO, 2015).</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What can be done to defend against an attack?</h2>
  <p>There are many ways to defend against such threats such as: Installing a firewall which is a virtual wall between the user and the internet, secondly, installing antivirus software and regularly scanning the device with it. Third, using two-step
    verification for logging into sensitive things such as your email, lastly, creating an alpha-numerical password such as (apodslewidndio) has a longer time to crack than simply (1234) as shown in the figure below. As for the future of
    cybersecurity, as more advanced technologies come out so will advanced ways to penetrate the sensitive data they hold. <br> Figure 1</p>

  <h3>Types of attacks </h3>
  <br>
  <p>Cyber attacks happen when there is a vulnerability or weakness in an internet-connected device, some of many types of attacks are: </p>

  <h3>Malware attack: </h3>
  <br>
  <p>Malware such as Trojan, adware and spyware is one of the most common types of virus which can allow the hacker to leak personal information, take control of the system or delete the data stored. Notably, malicious software (malware) is embedded
    within the attachments that the user installs from the internet.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Password attack:</h3>
  <br>
  <p>A password attack on the easiest way to breach one’s sensitive information. This most commonly occurs when the targeted system has a simple or alphabetical password.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Phishing attack:</h3>
  <br>
  <p>Phishing is the attempt to gain access to personal information, credit card details and login in details. Essentially, Phishing is most commonly used in emails with the intention of making the reader click the link attached, most commonly these
    emails will be fake invoices of purchases, a reward for a competition the user did not enter, or a bill that scares the person to click the link or else. Consequently, when the user clicks the link it will most often take them to a fake website
    that is identical to the one that is imitating. In one such case, the user will enter their login details and password which is then used by the hacker on the real website.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Man-in-the-middle-attack:</h3>
  <br>
  <p>This form of a cyber attack most commonly occurs when a victim is on a public Wi-Fi or has malware installed. Essentially, the hacker gains access to the information path between the victim and the server of what they're accessing. When this
    occurs, the hacker takes of the victims IP address and intercepts the communication between the unsuspecting victim and the internet.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Denial of service (DoS) attack: </h3>
  <br>
  <p>Most commonly used against corporations this form of an attacker sends a large amount of traffic to for example a website, which in turn, makes legitimate users unable to access the site as the servers are overloaded. Additionally, another form
    of denial of service can be deliberately entering the wrong password enough times to cause the victims account to be locked out.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>The future of Cybersecurity </h3>
  <p>No one can predict the future, however, one thing for certain is that as more people become connected to the internet, hackers will find more ways to exploit their unsuspecting victims. (Morgan, 2019) predicts that the number of humans on the
    internet will reach six billion by the year 2022. As a result, there will be an even more shortage than there currently is in the cybersecurity job market. (Morgan, 2019) also predicts that there will be 3.1 unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally
    by 2021. Subsequently these two forecasts of the future result in the lack of ability to protect all users. To combat this, one-day people will be able to call the police to report a cybercrime as if someone broke into their home. Some cities
    already have implemented a cybercrime division in their law enforcement such as New York and Atlanta. In addition, to mitigate the shortage of skilled workers, artificial intelligence and machine learning may hold the potential to eliminate some
    positions.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
  <p>As people on the internet and jobs to protect their data grow. Corporations, governments, hospitals, and financial institutions around the world are going to face severe risk from getting attacked. (Morgan, 2020) state that there will be a
    fifteen per cent rise in cost a year, resulting in $10.5 trillion in cybercrime cost by the year 2025. Cybercrime attacks do not just happen from criminals, China was suspected of attacking Australia with the goal of targeting Australian COVID-19
    data, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a press conference (Welch, Hui and Dziedzic, 2020) "This activity is targeting Australian organisations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organisations,
    education, health, essential service providers, and operators of other critical infrastructure,". In conclusion, Cybersecurity is and is going to affect everyone by either exposing sensitive information or by stealing money people and
    organisations around the world. Hopefully, the implementation of artificial intelligence will lighten the workload of the immensely expanding workforce.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
  <p>In the future people will have to be more vigilant when they are online as a threat will grow and have already grown to the point that a person could gain access and control your camera, fridge, phone, lights and smart home. Additionally, on a
    larger scale, a hacker could take away the internet in general for example. (Fruhlinger, 2018) says “On October 12, 2016, a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack left much of the internet inaccessible on the U.S. east coast. The
    attack, which authorities initially feared was the work of a hostile nation-state, was, in fact, the work of the Mirai botnet.” In conclusion, the future will affect people immensely to the point you might have a family member with a fake
    Facebook account made by a hacker,</p>
