    <br>
    <img src="Img\MignoneIdealJob.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <br>
    <p>My ideal Job involve being responsible for analysis, design, development, testing, debugging, troubleshooting and modification of complex software products and applications. I would like to work in a company with two departments: the internal
      departments and external Salesforce. Solving problem skill with a methodical approach will be needed. There will be challenges during my work that will test my skills and push to learn more and deliver more even beyond expectations. Knowledge
      of coding, a scripted language will be also required. The following type of scripting can be used such as coding for e.g., PHP/HTML/CSS/JS/Node, C#/C++/C/Java, Powershell, SQL, VBA. <br>
      I would like to work in a large company with many employees around the world in many countries and with a large budget worldwide. A company which is a world market leader in the trade or computer solutions. With this structure and organisation
      come a lot of responsibility. Here are some that might apply: <br>
      1.Providing prompt response and resolution to all support calls/requests ensuring a great end user experience.<br>
      2.Logging, addressing, and resolving all incidents, service requests, changes, problems, and projects. <br>
      3.Assisting the IT Service Desk as a point of contact to all internal and external staff on IT issues.<br>
      4.Meeting and exceeding our SLA's for classifying, resolving requests, and answering phone calls.<br>
      5.Creating and cultivating a positive customer experience, escalating, and communicating promptly on progress and helping customers with a professional attitude. <br>
      6.Documenting IT processes and procedures i.e. How-to guides, troubleshooting documentation, daily/monthly procedures etc. <br>
      7.Work on new and existing sites and developments to a high standard of quality.<br>
      8.Requirements analysis, design, development, testing, debugging, troubleshooting of Web Portals/Apps.<br>
      9.Developing efficiencies in processes and procedure by automation/scripting. <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I would like a job that offers exceptional opportunities to work with executives, progress quickly in my career, collaborate with talented people, and to travel to new places. At this level of responsibility, I would like to work directly with
      CEOs and the executive teams very early in my career. This will enable me to start developing a lot of the soft skills I will need to become a senior executive later (e.g., convincing people who do not agree with me, managing difficult
      stakeholders, presenting to large audiences with little time to prepare, etc.). This unique opportunity will help me help to be promoted easily because my work will be appreciated directly by the top executive team.<br><br>
      A job that will give me a special opportunity to rise quickly in IT industry which usually take people first few years of their career before to get promoted. They usually must wait for multiple promotions to have exposure to their company’s
      management.<br><br>
      One of the perks of working with senior executives is that they focus on the toughest problems their company faces. This means the work that I will do as a consultant can have a lot of impact on a company. However, this might not 100% rosy
      picture, but it will give me a sense of what some executives are thinking. I will be at the forefront in innovating and creating new opportunities for the company by for example designing project that will open new market opportunities. The
      company that is easily accessible via internet will benefit from new opportunities worldwide. The E commerce is a fastest growing advertising tool that the company should take full advantage. Strategies like having a youtube channel that are
      both intuitive and interactive will attract new customers and widened the company base market and at the same time boost it revenue. I will implement idea and design structures from other companies and firms that have already YouTube channel,
      website, and Facebook page. One of the easiest to keep in touch with work colleague and administration are the WhatsApp’s group. This work will allow me to send messages that will reach many work colleagues a short period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside this, the I will be conducting research, surveys and interviews to gain understanding of the business, analysing statistics, detecting issues and investigating ways to resolve them, assessing the pros and cons of possible strategies,
      compiling and presenting information orally, visually and in writing, making recommendations for improvement, using computer models to test them and presenting findings to the executive committee, implementing agreed solutions, developing and
      implementing new procedures or training. I will be able to be nimble and versatile in their work in the company. I will be able to provide a well-designed software that will help the company in different area such as manufacturing, marketing,
      distribution, and interaction with existing and potential customers.<br><br>
      A system which can receive feedback from these sus-mentioned areas and improve the system. The system I will implement will enable to cut cost while providing quality service. This is an intense Job that will need commitment and abnegation. The
      rate of learning, the speed of change and the complexity of decision might have a toll on the candidate physical and mental health. That why most I must take time off to relax, rewind and recharge. The company must also be open to any mental
      health issue such as stress, anxiety, and financial issues. These are usually issues encounter during the first year of work before building resilience in the future.<br><br>
      I would like to be given responsibilities much more quickly than my industry peers. If I have proven that I am ready to my job’s responsibility, I will be easily promoted to a senior role without delay without to wait for a manager role to free
      up to be promoted. The speed at which I will progress in consulting is virtually only limited by my own abilities. The company will invest a lot in the candidate training, up skilling to better provide services for the company. I will work hard
      for the company to consider me as its main asset and it pay a particular attention to my training. My journey into the company will be facilitated by my ability to work as a team while providing leadership. These are some of the qualities and
      requirements that are expected for the candidate to have for this job.</p>

    <h4>COSC2196 Introduction to Information Technology Assessment 1: Report of content </h4>

    <p>This is a Project Idea Report of PC Based Notice Board Project, it is an innovation which it’s important because it can help organisations such as Schools, Colleges, institutions, stadium, company, factory, office as well other government
      facilities in order to display notices, events or other alerts using a PC to control it. The system is designed to display a scrolling text message on an electronic notice board using a PC to control it. Well notice boards are usually used to
      pin news, events and other data to be displayed from time to time. It has an important element, that it can be updated when needed. The matching functionality is provided by an electronic notice board. The pc is used as a controlling device for
      txt to be shown on the notice board.
      The system has great benefit over traditional notice boards. It can so be applied at a variety of places including, colleges, institutes, railway, banks, offices, training places, bus and many additional areas. It makes message presentation
      very easy and convenient process. <br><br>
      The message data sent from a pc is converted and fed to a microcontroller of 8051 family going via a Max232 interfacing IC. Essential DATA is stored in a microcontroller interfaced with external memory. After that an LCD screen used to
      demonstrate as a notice board is interfaced with the microcontroller to show the message sent through the PC as a scrolling text. <br><br>

    <h3>Personal information:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>With 13 years of experience in medical laboratories, serving five different hospitals, something that has stood out for me is the great potential error due to improperly setup medical information programs. Specifically, the opportunity for
      error in describing sample types, or patient conditions, between systems that have been built independently of one another.<br><br>
      My interest in IT was peaked in 2017 when I tasked myself with correcting these errors for the hospital laboratory I worked in. It was a much bigger project than I anticipated, which is what I attribute to such things being ignored by directors
      and managers as ‘too hard’ and too easy to ignore. No matter how far I go in life I will always remember this: The ground staff know more than their managers and the talent to fix these issues is in them as well.<br><br>
      My ideal job would be in the medical profession as a cross trained clinical and IT member to coordinate and implement these health care systems locally and across networks. I am a problem solver and I am also a problem finder. I find errors in
      systems and correct them. The reason these errors are not recognised is that they have been built incorrectly due to the disconnect between the high level professional capabilities of clinical and IT staff. Coming from a clinical background I
      intend to bridge that gap to have a greater impact on improving health care than I am capable of now. I have spent the last few years attaining an MBA and an MSc in health care management to understand the managerial state of mind. The next
      step is to improve my IT capabilities and credentials to be able better articulate and hopefully soon, to make the changes others are not equipped to make.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This proposal is to have a check program that can be shared between IT and clinical personnel for the development of a new system, or as a routine check for existing medical data networks. It is simple to run and offers side by side
      comparisons for simple presentation to the user.<br><br>
      This will eliminate confusing mixes of terms that given the sheer number of cases do lead to adverse medical outcomes.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My goal, starting with this first proper step into IT, is to improve patient care and outcomes in the digital space within which our hospitals and clinics operate. Using the hospital as a familiar example, this can be just as easily
      implemented into any large or small scale clinic or organisation. Each hospital has an EMR (Electronic Health Record) which is the primary source of a patient’s information. This EMR is typically connected to around 200 others systems and
      middle-wares. An EMR is connected to pharmacy, laboratory and even dietaries for meal restrictions: </p>
    <br>
    <img src="Img\StevenGraph1.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 1: <a
        href="https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-emr-systems-software-electronic-medical-record-systems.html">https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-emr-systems-software-electronic-medical-record-systems.html</a>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>A confusing factor that emerges from all of this integration is that similar, but different names or terms are used for the same description in different systems. For example, ‘lung washing’ may be collected in theatre, but appear on the
      laboratory system as ‘bronchial lavage’. This isn’t inherently incorrect, but is a difference great enough that causes confusion in such a highly specific industry. A greater example may be ‘lung fluid’, which frankly could be any number of
      things vs the specific ‘bronchial lavage’ which should be the same across systems and disciplines. A ‘lung fluid’ could be ordered, but interpreted by the lab as a cyst drainage getting well off track from the intention. <br>Ultimately it is
      the patient that suffers from mistreatment and clinical personnel in time spent collaborating. <br><br>
      These errors can easily be mitigated by a check program that compares the same outputs of each of the systems. This would save an organisation or network great amounts of time checking and conferring between departments, as well as mitigate the
      risk for misinterpretation and patient treatment.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The following is an example of the project that inspired me to learn IT on a path towards health care informatics:</p>
    <img src="Img\SteveGraph2.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 2: Smith, S. 2017. Microbiology Container and Specimen Types. Presentation to PLMI UBC, 5th of October 2017 at CCAD.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Figure two shows two examples of common terms that are completely valid within their own systems (hospital system and lab system), but have completely different relevancies in practice. The terms shown are inadequate and the growth of these
      bacteria are normal and irrelevant in the laboratory for most clinical circumstances.<br><br>
      “Wound culture” is too ambiguous, but is commonly used. The pictures for wound culture show a normal skin flora on the left that is clinically insignificant and not reported. The same shown on the right would be the cause of serious infection
      that needs to be treated.<br><br>
      “Fluid” from the body can contain any number of normal flora (normal bacteria), however some fluids are from inner and sterile parts of the body where the same normal bacteria can cause harm and infection.<br><br>
      This is but one, very small, example of a clinical situation where specificity is absolutely key. The health care system is immensely greater than this scenario and one can imagine the amount of time a physiotherapist must put into contacting
      doctors, wards and surgeons to determine the right recovery process for a patient without the proper clinical picture that should be a standardised language.<br><br>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Tools and technologies:</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>There is a tool, or tools rather, that are already implemented in health care, but are not strictly mandatory. These are the SNOWMED (for semantics in language) nomenclature system and HL7 (Health Language version 7). Implementation of these
      systems is common, but what they don’t do is translate the information to the end user.<br><br>
      For example: SNOWMED may dictate ECOL as the code for E. coli across systems, but the text presented may be E. coli, Escherichia coli, EC, or Enterobacteriaciae. This may confuse an end user who is used to seeing a particular terminology as
      they quickly read or review a record.<br><br>
      A better example would be Lung Fluid which may be LFLD under SNOWMED and each system’s database, but will expand to ‘Lung Fluid’ in the pathology lab, ‘Fluid, Lung’ in the operating theatre, ‘Body Fluid, Lung’ in pharmacy and ‘Body Fluid’ in
      the rehabilitation ward. The meaning changes slightly each time and the correspondence between departments becomes confusing. This needs to be standardised across all network platforms.<br><br>
      The new tool to do this is a software program that can receive manual input from each department as to what they would like as a terminology during the development stage so a democratic choice can be made. Alternatively, a standardised input
      for all departments can be created and kept on the one database.<br><br>
    </p><img src="Img\StevenGraph3.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 3: Smith, S. 2021. Assignment 1 for Introduction to IT. 20/01/21.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Figure 3 shows the simple comparison that can be made. With the background SNOWMED code on the left corresponding to its expanded text in each system. ‘Penicillin’ has been shortened to ‘Pen.’ In the emergency department. This discrepancy is
      easily recognised after scanning and highlighted for possible correction.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Skills required:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The skill sets to run such a program are more than present in a health care environment. The difficulty being the communication between the IT professionals and clinical professionals that speak different specialised languages. For example, it
      cannot be expected for an IT professional to have the clinical education as well to distinguish between subtly different types of surgical specimens. Neither is it reasonable to expect a surgeon to be able to comprehend the informatics and
      information processing between the OR and pharmacy.<br><br>
      Thus, a program that can detect and highlight language deficiencies amongst the great number of systems is a hugely helpful tool. Once a detection is made a side by side comparison can be made. A clinical person can verify the correct
      terminology and the system administrator can make the correction.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The dictionary of terms and nomenclature is absolutely key to clear and efficient communication. Contributions to the shared master document can allow for direct comparisons of terms across all medical disciplines so that interpretation is
      consistent and clear. This master document can be given access to automatically update terms in each system once a consensus is achieved, or can withhold a report from release if there is mismatch in clinical terminology.<br><br>
      It is well known that requests for change are often submitted to IT from clinicians, so this ‘gate keeper’ can alert a non-clinical IT professional of a possible conflict in other areas of the network. The program can run live in the background
      in case of a change, or can periodically scan health care system for inconsistencies that can presented to a user with a side by side comparison that is easy to resolve.<br><br>

      Kassiotis to defend his nation. </p><br>
    <h3>Interest In IT</h3>
    <h4>Interest in I.T and when it started</h4><br>
    <p>In the vast I.T industry, I'm particularly fascinated by cybersecurity, software as a service, implementation of innovative software or products. lastly, data, and how it can improve efficiency. I believe my fascination began at a young age,
      I loved business and technology, after studying a bachelor’s in business I realized I don't like human recourses. as a result, that cemented my ambition in the information technology industry for my future.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Particular event that sparked my interest and my experience</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I remember at a young age watching iron man make revolutionary technology to help save people. secondly, the movie Jobs showed the beginning of Apple and how Steve Jobs changed the world with a single device that fits in my pocket.
      Unfortunately, I'm lacking much experience however I have self-taught the programming languages HTML, CSS, java, and I have bought courses in cybersecurity, python, and JavaScript that I will commence shortly.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Why I chose RMIT</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I chose RMIT for my studies for it offers courses online and in the key subjects I have an ambition in (Cloud Computing, Security in Computing and IT).</p><br><br>
    <h4>What I expect to learn during my studies</h4><br>
    <p>I plan on completing a bachelor's in information technology with a minor in accounting and electives in economics and marketing. I expect and hope my studies with RMIT will teach me the in-demand skills in the industry. additionally, the
      mindset of a person in the industry.</p>

    <h3>What the results mean to me.</h3>
    <p>I believe the results of these test can help me better understand and navigate my phyci. however, I do question the validity of the test as the NSW Government's Career quiz overlaps with the Myer-Briggs test, also I have taken the Myer-Briggs
      test four time in my life which resulted in two different answers (INFJ and INTJ) either I have slipt personality's and need to see the doctor or your personality changes with the environment that your in and what you have done recently.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Project Idea (Dylan Kassiotis)</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>My project idea is a study aid application named Moleti (Greek word for study). Moleti will help students with memorization by having a flashcard and Pomodoro timer functionality. Secondly, Moleti will also have notetaking that would allow the
      user to reflect upon their notes in the Cornell notetaking method. And Moleti will have organizational benefits by allowing the user to make their study calendar to evolve around their life schedule. As a result of these functionalities
      students should be able to memorise the information for longer and be able to reflect upon there notes at ease after there studies.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>I believe many of the features of Moleti will have a beneficial impact on decision making, productivity and memorisation of its users. For instance, (Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso, 2011) reveal in a study that during daily proceedings, the
      likelihood of a favourable conviction from a judge will gradually fall around 65%. However, after the judge has had recess the likelihood of a favourable and fair conviction will rise by around 65%. Secondly, (Ariga and Lleras, 2011) did a
      study that uncovers that the decrementation of focus during long task’s such as studying is avoidable by implementing brief breaks where you focus your attention on a secondary task.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Moleti will revolutionize the way you study, available on desktop and online, it will have the feature Pomodoro Method with this feature you will be able to use the popular time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. </p>
    <p>To use this feature, you can click the task section to write down your objectives to complete during the Pomodoro. Meanwhile, set the estimated time to complete that task (note one Pomodoro equals twenty-five minutes). Afterwards, select the
      task that you would like to complete then start the timer. Once started, work for twenty-five minutes then have a five-minute break when the audio notification system starts. If you do not want to do the pre-set timer you can also customize the
      time to suit your preference. </p>
    <p> The second feature Moleti has is the Cornell note-taking system, with this feature you can create a new document and then write in the Cornell style, edit it or change its layout, delete it, download as a pdf, or print and share it.
      Additionally, you can click the flashiphy button to make the bullet points into flashcards. With the third feature of flashcards, you can download pre-existing online or make your own. The Flashcards are also downloadable to print or share.
      This is a useful tool for revision and memorization.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the Organizer feature is an organization tool that can be used to make a mind map, a to-do list, or an org-chart, this feature is ideal for teamwork as you can set objectives and see what your team mates are doing.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Tools and techologies</h4>
    <p>The Tools and technologies required in order to make a web and software application would be programming languages such as
    <ul>
      <li> HTML which handles the text</li>
      <li> CSS is the colour and design elements</li>
      <li> lastly JavaScript which is used for the animations For the ide Atom would be used as a text editor, file manager, compiler and a translator.</li>
    </ul>

    Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop would be used for the design of the user interface components. Another language that could be used is Java which is an object-oriented programming language that supports web and desktop (Windows) applications, it
    is also compatible for Android applications.
    </p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
    <p>To make the application, experience with the programming languages: Java, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript would be needed. Furthermore, knowledge of the IDE Atom would be essential to be able to use the languages listed. Additionally, the general
      ability to be able to find (google) the solution to a roadblock. In the case of not having these skills, it is quite easy to find the skills and software simply Google Atom or the programming languages. However, to learn them, I would recommend
      online recourses such as YouTube, Udemy, or W3Schools.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>In the case of the project being successful, it would have immensely improved the memorisation and organization for students around the world. By, providing its users with the Pomodoro method to aid the effectiveness of their studying.
      Additionally, the implementation of the Cornell Note-taking system which would aid with more organised notes and the reduction of editing. Consequently, The application could improve the average passing rate of students and their ability to
      retain the information.</p>

    <h3>What are the job titles for your group’s ideal jobs?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Using the Burning Glass data from the course instructions page there were 121,991 job postings available on February 28th 2018 for the previous 12 months in Australia and New Zealand:</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>From this selection and our personal profiles our team’s ideal job titles are as follows:</p>
    <br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Dylan: </td>
        <td>Cyber/information security engineer/analyst </td>
        <td>2,914 (2.4%)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mignone:</td>
        <td>Software developer/engineer </td>
        <td>29,456 (24%)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Steven:</td>
        <td>Systems analyst </td>
        <td>11,402 (9.3%)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>Mignone’s passion and the project our team has decided to work on has the most job availability, whereas Dylan has a more specialised passion. We all bring a certain diversity to the team, which is what is required in the industry.<br><br>
      It’s important to note that this data is a ranking according to employer’s demand, but there will likely be fewer people competing for the more specialised roles and the broader talents required are reflected in the job titles most
      advertised.<br><br>
      It is important to note, that in IT there are many cross-overs between specific job titles. For example, Dylan as a securities specialist will need much knowledge in database and network administration, as well as software. Mignone and I will
      need knowledge in hardware and programming, although specialised members of the team can be assigned to specific tasks. For all of these job titles and certain level of knowledge is required across the board despite our specific functions. </p>

    <h3>How do the IT-specific skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>The specific skills such as Java, SQL, etc can only be determined by local implementation. Currently C++ and SQL/non-SQL are in demand with items such as Javascript on the decline but still very prevalent.<br><br>
      Computer systems/engineer and Computer programmer and software QA engineer/developer would all come with specific languages and requirements for the specific software in use or to be created. These ‘programmers’ make up a good portion of over
      20% of the Burning Glass jobs. An important note from this data is that the large majority of jobs are in the use of IT, rather building anew.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>The following is the data set provided in the course materials from Burning Glass:</p>
    <img src="Img\InddATAgRAPH2.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Labour Insight Jobs (Burning Glass Technologies) <a href="file:///C:/Users/JohnnyRico/Downloads/Top%20IT%20Skills%20March%202018.pdf">file:///C:/Users/JohnnyRico/Downloads/Top%20IT%20Skills%20March%202018.pdf</a> </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>There is a focus on coding in this data that is a reflection of the wider consumption of these products. SQL is clearly leading the way as the most widely used programming language, thus would apply to more roles as described in jobs listing
      data set. <br><br>
      For each one of our team members coding is a very important skill either for development, as in Mignone’s case and for execution in Dylan’s case. A certain degree of knowledge of these skills is required for any of the job positions depending
      on what the organisation is using, or plans to use. For example, Python skills would not be as valuable as SQL to an organisation that does not operate with Python.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>What are the three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3>

    <br><br>
    <p>For me, personally, the highest ranked skill that is not likely to be required in my skill set for working in health care informatics would be Javascript, JAVA and graphic design. Javascript and JAVA very rarely appear in the field and the
      graphic design component is already set upon purchase. The role of informatics I will looking for relies on the correct expression of data working much more with people and process rather than coding the system architecture. Other skills such
      as project management and building relationships would be far more valuable.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>What are the three highest ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h3><br><br>
    <p>Computer systems engineer/architect, web developer and graphic designer are the three highest ranked general skills which are not likely to be part of my required skill set. This is because health care informatics is largely an exercise in
      working with clinical professionals to achieve the best health outcomes. There are places for engineers and architects to build the programs in a more computer science type role, but I will be using them, adapting them and teaching them. Web
      development is well outside the scope and the graphic designed are already implemented from a purchased product.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Having viewed the Burning Glass data my opinion has not changed of my ideal job. I am only encouraged that a systems analyst is in high demand, ranking third. The I will be seeking is of one that can bridge the gap between clinical, medical
      professionals, and IT professionals.<br><br>
      Having worked in health care for 13 years and been involved in some heavy lifting informatics projects for a few years, there is a clear divide between the specialties that has very few crossing to learn the other. I believe that a person of a
      clinical background with a broad knowledge of IT could be of immense benefit to setting up health care IT systems and operating them with the clinical users. I envision a role as a systems analyst that has the clinical background to build,
      correct and modify health care programs with a team of IT professionals with their own talents. A translator if you will, or a coordinator that can predict and recognise an operation as it flows through dozens, or hundreds, of specialised
      clinical programs. <br><br>

    <p>Phone interview conducted with Raymond Buchannan – Senior Manager of LIS (Laboratory Information Systems) at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. Conducted at 0200 24/01/21.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Well, the IT professional generally speaking is a very all-round talent. There are many specialised courses, which are great, but there is everything from coding base programs to customer support. <br> </p>
    <p>Communication skills are essential as there is a middle-ground between the client and the IT professional. We can’t be talking IT to someone in clinical services, but we need to understand what they need in a very clinical setting.<br><br>
      Flexibility is also very important. We spend a lot of time trouble shooting with our clients, so it’s important to know as much about their role as we can. Being able to operate the systems is one thing, but to deliver on client expectations by
      developing the systems with the client are the most crucial.<br>
    </p>

    <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>
    <p>The IT professional interacts with the whole diversity of people. Right now at Cleveland Clinic these are mostly clinical professionals who need a problem solved. It is usually a training issue that we can walk our client through working
      together. <br><br>
      Perhaps the most wonderful thing about working in IT is that there are no borders to the internet and we have professionals from a global resource pool to work with instead of more local talent. It is always so fantastic to count the number of
      countries represented.<br><br>
      The IT professional will interact with all of the above depending on their role. There is an important distinction to be made between IT and computer science. Some people are gifted in their ability to create from a computer science background,
      whereas the IT professional requires an all-round talent to be able to communicate with a very diverse clientele.
    </p>
    <br> <br>

    <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
    <p>As it is no surprise, I’m sure, we spend most of our time on our laptops. The second most important piece of equipment is the phone. <br><br>
      During the lead up to operations beginning at CCAD we had a very small team of three people. We began this project working from an office building and transferring and building the data base. This was a 9 hour a day operation for us to have the
      system ready before the clinical staff arrived.<br><br>
      When clinical staff began arriving we moved into the hospital to be on site. Our day was still very much the same working through issues identified and training clinical staff in the use of the EMR and LIS [electronic medical record, laboratory
      information system].<br><br>
      Today, we spend our time mostly at our desks with a team of 6 people mostly troubleshooting, but also creating opportunities for improvement. We are watching live feeds of information being passed between the LIS and EMR and catching data
      errors at the gates. We will correct these errors so that the data may flow through and not impact our clinical operators. We spend a lot of time troubleshooting with our clients on the phone, mostly helping them to perform tests orders and
      navigate their systems.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>What aspect of their position is the most challenging?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The most wonderful part of the role and the most challenging is the cultural diversity. It is great to trouble shoot with people of so many different backgrounds, but it is crucial to remember that cultural differences and English being a
      second or fourth language can lead to mistranslation or slight understanding. I’ve worked in the US most of my life and that is certainly a difference between then and working in the Middle East. It is an absolute joy, but communication is
      always the most important and most challenging wherever we are in the world. <br><br>
      I would also have to mention that IT staff are never truly off work. We always have someone on call at least for clinical support, but most nights we are still working from home. Many times into the late hours of the night. It is a pleasure and
      a privilege, but also comes at the cost of managing one’s personal commitments. <br><br>Questions were provided to Ray in advance and answered over a phone interview at 0200 24/01/21 Australian time (the United Arab Emirates is 7 hours behind
      EDST).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Comments and thoughts by Steve</h3>
    <p>I thought Ray was very candid and genuine in this interview. He clearly has a deep love for his industry and great pride in being able to deliver health care. <br><br>
      I also work in a very multi-cultural industry and understand what Ray is trying to express. Diversity can be leveraged to great effect in collecting different ideas and approaches to problem solving and creation, but a native English speaker
      must always keep in mind the nuances of language when sending and receiving verbal and written communications. <br><br>
      The downside to being an IT professional in Ray’s role is the ‘always on-call’ and the amount of trouble-shooting with user clients. I have been in the situation before and understand that this can be a frustrating element of the role when
      clients don’t understand the process. Ray finds this as an opportunity to improve the service through teaching and learning. I hope I can be positive too when it’s my turn.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>Comments and thoughts by Mignone:</h3>
    <p>I have enjoyed reading through Steven’s interview. I thought he had good understanding of his work. He provided details about how he will go about. He was also relaxed which is a good asset especially for a stressful job. This will allow him
      to take meaningful decision at work. He also had a good understanding of the type of co-worker which will help him forge good relationship which is key for A team work.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Comments and thoughts by Dylan:</h3>
    <p>I find it fascinating to hear the life of an IT professional residing in Abu Dhabi as described by Raymond Buchannan. I believe Raymond has expressed some of the complications of working in the IT field in a foreign speaking country such as:
      Miscommunication. Which could prove difficult to help troubleshoot for clients. Secondly, having to answer the phone after work hours would certainly become a task to juggle with your home life. <br><br> However, I believe this shows Raymond's
      love for what he does. Furthermore, Raymond expressed a key skill needed in the IT field which would be the need to be able to explain an IT subject in an easy-to-understand manner for those who do not understand and the ability to understand
      the client's industry's whichever it may be. In conclusion, this interview has shown that there are different challenges for different industries, the IT professional spends most of their time behind a screen to complete their tasks. <br><br>
      In a positive note, Raymond has also brought to light some of the Benefits of IT such as diversity of culture and knowledge and helping people and helping solve their problems. </p>

  <div id="Project-Idea's" class="Grey-background">
    <h1>Project Ideas</h1>

    <h2>Ass. 2 Project Ideas by Mignone</h2>
    <p>We as A team group have developed an Idea of having a mobile phone apps that can translate in different languages. Australia is a multicultural country with people from different background with English not being their first language. We
      thought by designing this app it will help many citizens to understand instructions. This will have a wide range application in the society. Many people with skills are left out because of language barriers. We think will their learning
      English, they can be employed and contribute to the society. <br><br>Smartphone are relatively new and have become a necessity for life. We cannot sometimes work without mobile phones. However, the history of mobile phones goes in the early
      nineties
      when a US Patent was issued in Kentucky for a wireless telephone. Mobile phones were invented as early as the 1940s when engineers working at AT&T developed cells for mobile phone base stations. The very first mobile phones were not really
      mobile phones at all. They were two-way radios that allowed people like taxi drivers and the emergency services to communicate. <br><br> Instead of relying on base stations with separate cells (and the signal being passed from one cell to
      another),
      the first mobile phone networks involved one very powerful base station covering a much wider area. Mobile technology is indispensable in the modern workplace. Due to its versatility, it offers a range of benefits, but also comes with
      considerable risks to the business. <br><br>It is essential to consider both advantages and disadvantages of using mobile technology in business. Also, the app can help them understand the functioning different devices. There are number of
      portable
      devices that have evolve over the years. Some examples are and not limited to laptop, tablets and netbook computers, smartphones, global positioning system (GPS) devices, wireless debit/credit card payment terminals. These devices uses
      different technologies for communication such as: wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) - a type of wireless local area network technology, Bluetooth - connects mobile devices wirelessly, data networking services for mobile phones - such as 3G, 4G and 5G
      wireless cellular technologies, global system for mobile communications (GSM) and general packet radio service (GPRS) data services, dial-up services - data networking services using modems and telephone lines, virtual private networks - secure
      access to a private network. These technologies enable us to network mobile devices, such as phones and laptops, to our offices or the internet while travelling. There are a lot of benefits for using these devices such as: higher efficiency and
      productivity of staff, quality, and flexibility of service you offer your customers, the ability to accept payments wirelessly, increased ability to communicate in and out of the workplace, greater access to modern apps and services improved
      networking capabilities and these devices can link us A team group directly into the office network while working off-site. Even from a remote distance, we can for example: set up a new customer's account, access existing customer records,
      check prices or place an order online. <br><br>
      The rapid developments in cloud technologies are boosting the use of mobile devices in business, supporting more flexible working practices, and accessing services over the internet. During the COVID 19 pandemic, the smartphone and computer
      have proven a valuable tool especially working from home. Many workers have chosen to work from home, organising zoom meeting and webinar seminar and training sessions. </p>
