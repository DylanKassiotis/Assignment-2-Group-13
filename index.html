    <br>
    <img src="Img\MignoneIdealJob.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <br>
    <p>My ideal Job involve being responsible for analysis, design, development, testing, debugging, troubleshooting and modification of complex software products and applications. I would like to work in a company with two departments: the internal
      departments and external Salesforce. Solving problem skill with a methodical approach will be needed. There will be challenges during my work that will test my skills and push to learn more and deliver more even beyond expectations. Knowledge
      of coding, a scripted language will be also required. The following type of scripting can be used such as coding for e.g., PHP/HTML/CSS/JS/Node, C#/C++/C/Java, Powershell, SQL, VBA. <br>
      I would like to work in a large company with many employees around the world in many countries and with a large budget worldwide. A company which is a world market leader in the trade or computer solutions. With this structure and organisation
      come a lot of responsibility. Here are some that might apply: <br>
      1.Providing prompt response and resolution to all support calls/requests ensuring a great end user experience.<br>
      2.Logging, addressing, and resolving all incidents, service requests, changes, problems, and projects. <br>
      3.Assisting the IT Service Desk as a point of contact to all internal and external staff on IT issues.<br>
      4.Meeting and exceeding our SLA's for classifying, resolving requests, and answering phone calls.<br>
      5.Creating and cultivating a positive customer experience, escalating, and communicating promptly on progress and helping customers with a professional attitude. <br>
      6.Documenting IT processes and procedures i.e. How-to guides, troubleshooting documentation, daily/monthly procedures etc. <br>
      7.Work on new and existing sites and developments to a high standard of quality.<br>
      8.Requirements analysis, design, development, testing, debugging, troubleshooting of Web Portals/Apps.<br>
      9.Developing efficiencies in processes and procedure by automation/scripting. <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I would like a job that offers exceptional opportunities to work with executives, progress quickly in my career, collaborate with talented people, and to travel to new places. At this level of responsibility, I would like to work directly with
      CEOs and the executive teams very early in my career. This will enable me to start developing a lot of the soft skills I will need to become a senior executive later (e.g., convincing people who do not agree with me, managing difficult
      stakeholders, presenting to large audiences with little time to prepare, etc.). This unique opportunity will help me help to be promoted easily because my work will be appreciated directly by the top executive team.<br><br>
      A job that will give me a special opportunity to rise quickly in IT industry which usually take people first few years of their career before to get promoted. They usually must wait for multiple promotions to have exposure to their company’s
      management.<br><br>
      One of the perks of working with senior executives is that they focus on the toughest problems their company faces. This means the work that I will do as a consultant can have a lot of impact on a company. However, this might not 100% rosy
      picture, but it will give me a sense of what some executives are thinking. I will be at the forefront in innovating and creating new opportunities for the company by for example designing project that will open new market opportunities. The
      company that is easily accessible via internet will benefit from new opportunities worldwide. The E commerce is a fastest growing advertising tool that the company should take full advantage. Strategies like having a youtube channel that are
      both intuitive and interactive will attract new customers and widened the company base market and at the same time boost it revenue. I will implement idea and design structures from other companies and firms that have already YouTube channel,
      website, and Facebook page. One of the easiest to keep in touch with work colleague and administration are the WhatsApp’s group. This work will allow me to send messages that will reach many work colleagues a short period.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside this, the I will be conducting research, surveys and interviews to gain understanding of the business, analysing statistics, detecting issues and investigating ways to resolve them, assessing the pros and cons of possible strategies,
      compiling and presenting information orally, visually and in writing, making recommendations for improvement, using computer models to test them and presenting findings to the executive committee, implementing agreed solutions, developing and
      implementing new procedures or training. I will be able to be nimble and versatile in their work in the company. I will be able to provide a well-designed software that will help the company in different area such as manufacturing, marketing,
      distribution, and interaction with existing and potential customers.<br><br>
      A system which can receive feedback from these sus-mentioned areas and improve the system. The system I will implement will enable to cut cost while providing quality service. This is an intense Job that will need commitment and abnegation. The
      rate of learning, the speed of change and the complexity of decision might have a toll on the candidate physical and mental health. That why most I must take time off to relax, rewind and recharge. The company must also be open to any mental
      health issue such as stress, anxiety, and financial issues. These are usually issues encounter during the first year of work before building resilience in the future.<br><br>
      I would like to be given responsibilities much more quickly than my industry peers. If I have proven that I am ready to my job’s responsibility, I will be easily promoted to a senior role without delay without to wait for a manager role to free
      up to be promoted. The speed at which I will progress in consulting is virtually only limited by my own abilities. The company will invest a lot in the candidate training, up skilling to better provide services for the company. I will work hard
      for the company to consider me as its main asset and it pay a particular attention to my training. My journey into the company will be facilitated by my ability to work as a team while providing leadership. These are some of the qualities and
      requirements that are expected for the candidate to have for this job.</p>

    <h4>COSC2196 Introduction to Information Technology Assessment 1: Report of content </h4>

    <p>This is a Project Idea Report of PC Based Notice Board Project, it is an innovation which it’s important because it can help organisations such as Schools, Colleges, institutions, stadium, company, factory, office as well other government
      facilities in order to display notices, events or other alerts using a PC to control it. The system is designed to display a scrolling text message on an electronic notice board using a PC to control it. Well notice boards are usually used to
      pin news, events and other data to be displayed from time to time. It has an important element, that it can be updated when needed. The matching functionality is provided by an electronic notice board. The pc is used as a controlling device for
      txt to be shown on the notice board.
      The system has great benefit over traditional notice boards. It can so be applied at a variety of places including, colleges, institutes, railway, banks, offices, training places, bus and many additional areas. It makes message presentation
      very easy and convenient process. <br><br>
      The message data sent from a pc is converted and fed to a microcontroller of 8051 family going via a Max232 interfacing IC. Essential DATA is stored in a microcontroller interfaced with external memory. After that an LCD screen used to
      demonstrate as a notice board is interfaced with the microcontroller to show the message sent through the PC as a scrolling text. <br><br>

    <h3>Personal information:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>With 13 years of experience in medical laboratories, serving five different hospitals, something that has stood out for me is the great potential error due to improperly setup medical information programs. Specifically, the opportunity for
      error in describing sample types, or patient conditions, between systems that have been built independently of one another.<br><br>
      My interest in IT was peaked in 2017 when I tasked myself with correcting these errors for the hospital laboratory I worked in. It was a much bigger project than I anticipated, which is what I attribute to such things being ignored by directors
      and managers as ‘too hard’ and too easy to ignore. No matter how far I go in life I will always remember this: The ground staff know more than their managers and the talent to fix these issues is in them as well.<br><br>
      My ideal job would be in the medical profession as a cross trained clinical and IT member to coordinate and implement these health care systems locally and across networks. I am a problem solver and I am also a problem finder. I find errors in
      systems and correct them. The reason these errors are not recognised is that they have been built incorrectly due to the disconnect between the high level professional capabilities of clinical and IT staff. Coming from a clinical background I
      intend to bridge that gap to have a greater impact on improving health care than I am capable of now. I have spent the last few years attaining an MBA and an MSc in health care management to understand the managerial state of mind. The next
      step is to improve my IT capabilities and credentials to be able better articulate and hopefully soon, to make the changes others are not equipped to make.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>This proposal is to have a check program that can be shared between IT and clinical personnel for the development of a new system, or as a routine check for existing medical data networks. It is simple to run and offers side by side
      comparisons for simple presentation to the user.<br><br>
      This will eliminate confusing mixes of terms that given the sheer number of cases do lead to adverse medical outcomes.
    </p><br>
    <h3>Motivation:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My goal, starting with this first proper step into IT, is to improve patient care and outcomes in the digital space within which our hospitals and clinics operate. Using the hospital as a familiar example, this can be just as easily
      implemented into any large or small scale clinic or organisation. Each hospital has an EMR (Electronic Health Record) which is the primary source of a patient’s information. This EMR is typically connected to around 200 others systems and
      middle-wares. An EMR is connected to pharmacy, laboratory and even dietaries for meal restrictions: </p>
    <br>
    <img src="Img\StevenGraph1.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 1: <a
        href="https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-emr-systems-software-electronic-medical-record-systems.html">https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-emr-systems-software-electronic-medical-record-systems.html</a>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>A confusing factor that emerges from all of this integration is that similar, but different names or terms are used for the same description in different systems. For example, ‘lung washing’ may be collected in theatre, but appear on the
      laboratory system as ‘bronchial lavage’. This isn’t inherently incorrect, but is a difference great enough that causes confusion in such a highly specific industry. A greater example may be ‘lung fluid’, which frankly could be any number of
      things vs the specific ‘bronchial lavage’ which should be the same across systems and disciplines. A ‘lung fluid’ could be ordered, but interpreted by the lab as a cyst drainage getting well off track from the intention. <br>Ultimately it is
      the patient that suffers from mistreatment and clinical personnel in time spent collaborating. <br><br>
      These errors can easily be mitigated by a check program that compares the same outputs of each of the systems. This would save an organisation or network great amounts of time checking and conferring between departments, as well as mitigate the
      risk for misinterpretation and patient treatment.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The following is an example of the project that inspired me to learn IT on a path towards health care informatics:</p>
    <img src="Img\SteveGraph2.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 2: Smith, S. 2017. Microbiology Container and Specimen Types. Presentation to PLMI UBC, 5th of October 2017 at CCAD.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Figure two shows two examples of common terms that are completely valid within their own systems (hospital system and lab system), but have completely different relevancies in practice. The terms shown are inadequate and the growth of these
      bacteria are normal and irrelevant in the laboratory for most clinical circumstances.<br><br>
      “Wound culture” is too ambiguous, but is commonly used. The pictures for wound culture show a normal skin flora on the left that is clinically insignificant and not reported. The same shown on the right would be the cause of serious infection
      that needs to be treated.<br><br>
      “Fluid” from the body can contain any number of normal flora (normal bacteria), however some fluids are from inner and sterile parts of the body where the same normal bacteria can cause harm and infection.<br><br>
      This is but one, very small, example of a clinical situation where specificity is absolutely key. The health care system is immensely greater than this scenario and one can imagine the amount of time a physiotherapist must put into contacting
      doctors, wards and surgeons to determine the right recovery process for a patient without the proper clinical picture that should be a standardised language.<br><br>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Tools and technologies:</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>There is a tool, or tools rather, that are already implemented in health care, but are not strictly mandatory. These are the SNOWMED (for semantics in language) nomenclature system and HL7 (Health Language version 7). Implementation of these
      systems is common, but what they don’t do is translate the information to the end user.<br><br>
      For example: SNOWMED may dictate ECOL as the code for E. coli across systems, but the text presented may be E. coli, Escherichia coli, EC, or Enterobacteriaciae. This may confuse an end user who is used to seeing a particular terminology as
      they quickly read or review a record.<br><br>
      A better example would be Lung Fluid which may be LFLD under SNOWMED and each system’s database, but will expand to ‘Lung Fluid’ in the pathology lab, ‘Fluid, Lung’ in the operating theatre, ‘Body Fluid, Lung’ in pharmacy and ‘Body Fluid’ in
      the rehabilitation ward. The meaning changes slightly each time and the correspondence between departments becomes confusing. This needs to be standardised across all network platforms.<br><br>
      The new tool to do this is a software program that can receive manual input from each department as to what they would like as a terminology during the development stage so a democratic choice can be made. Alternatively, a standardised input
      for all departments can be created and kept on the one database.<br><br>
    </p><img src="Img\StevenGraph3.png" alt="ERROR: 404">
    <p>Figure 3: Smith, S. 2021. Assignment 1 for Introduction to IT. 20/01/21.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Figure 3 shows the simple comparison that can be made. With the background SNOWMED code on the left corresponding to its expanded text in each system. ‘Penicillin’ has been shortened to ‘Pen.’ In the emergency department. This discrepancy is
      easily recognised after scanning and highlighted for possible correction.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Skills required:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The skill sets to run such a program are more than present in a health care environment. The difficulty being the communication between the IT professionals and clinical professionals that speak different specialised languages. For example, it
      cannot be expected for an IT professional to have the clinical education as well to distinguish between subtly different types of surgical specimens. Neither is it reasonable to expect a surgeon to be able to comprehend the informatics and
      information processing between the OR and pharmacy.<br><br>
      Thus, a program that can detect and highlight language deficiencies amongst the great number of systems is a hugely helpful tool. Once a detection is made a side by side comparison can be made. A clinical person can verify the correct
      terminology and the system administrator can make the correction.<br><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Outcome:</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The dictionary of terms and nomenclature is absolutely key to clear and efficient communication. Contributions to the shared master document can allow for direct comparisons of terms across all medical disciplines so that interpretation is
      consistent and clear. This master document can be given access to automatically update terms in each system once a consensus is achieved, or can withhold a report from release if there is mismatch in clinical terminology.<br><br>
      It is well known that requests for change are often submitted to IT from clinicians, so this ‘gate keeper’ can alert a non-clinical IT professional of a possible conflict in other areas of the network. The program can run live in the background
      in case of a change, or can periodically scan health care system for inconsistencies that can presented to a user with a side by side comparison that is easy to resolve.<br><br>

    <p>In the vast I.T industry, I'm particularly fascinated by cybersecurity, software as a service, implementation of innovative software or products. lastly, data, and how it can improve efficiency. I believe my fascination began at a young age,
      I loved business and technology, after studying a bachelor’s in business I realized I don't like human recourses. as a result, that cemented my ambition in the information technology industry for my future.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Particular event that sparked my interest and my experience</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I remember at a young age watching iron man make revolutionary technology to help save people. secondly, the movie Jobs showed the beginning of Apple and how Steve Jobs changed the world with a single device that fits in my pocket.
      Unfortunately, I'm lacking much experience however I have self-taught the programming languages HTML, CSS, java, and I have bought courses in cybersecurity, python, and JavaScript that I will commence shortly.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Why I chose RMIT</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I chose RMIT for my studies for it offers courses online and in the key subjects I have an ambition in (Cloud Computing, Security in Computing and IT).</p><br><br>
    <h4>What I expect to learn during my studies</h4><br>
    <p>I plan on completing a bachelor's in information technology with a minor in accounting and electives in economics and marketing. I expect and hope my studies with RMIT will teach me the in-demand skills in the industry. additionally, the
      mindset of a person in the industry.</p>

    <h3>What the results mean to me.</h3>
    <p>I believe the results of these test can help me better understand and navigate my phyci. however, I do question the validity of the test as the NSW Government's Career quiz overlaps with the Myer-Briggs test, also I have taken the Myer-Briggs
      test four time in my life which resulted in two different answers (INFJ and INTJ) either I have slipt personality's and need to see the doctor or your personality changes with the environment that your in and what you have done recently.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <h3>Project Idea (Dylan Kassiotis)</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>My project idea is a study aid application named Moleti (Greek word for study). Moleti will help students with memorization by having a flashcard and Pomodoro timer functionality. Secondly, Moleti will also have notetaking that would allow the
      user to reflect upon their notes in the Cornell notetaking method. And Moleti will have organizational benefits by allowing the user to make their study calendar to evolve around their life schedule. As a result of these functionalities
      students should be able to memorise the information for longer and be able to reflect upon there notes at ease after there studies.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>I believe many of the features of Moleti will have a beneficial impact on decision making, productivity and memorisation of its users. For instance, (Danziger, Levav and Avnaim-Pesso, 2011) reveal in a study that during daily proceedings, the
      likelihood of a favourable conviction from a judge will gradually fall around 65%. However, after the judge has had recess the likelihood of a favourable and fair conviction will rise by around 65%. Secondly, (Ariga and Lleras, 2011) did a
      study that uncovers that the decrementation of focus during long task’s such as studying is avoidable by implementing brief breaks where you focus your attention on a secondary task.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Moleti will revolutionize the way you study, available on desktop and online, it will have the feature Pomodoro Method with this feature you will be able to use the popular time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo. </p>
    <p>To use this feature, you can click the task section to write down your objectives to complete during the Pomodoro. Meanwhile, set the estimated time to complete that task (note one Pomodoro equals twenty-five minutes). Afterwards, select the
      task that you would like to complete then start the timer. Once started, work for twenty-five minutes then have a five-minute break when the audio notification system starts. If you do not want to do the pre-set timer you can also customize the
      time to suit your preference. </p>
    <p> The second feature Moleti has is the Cornell note-taking system, with this feature you can create a new document and then write in the Cornell style, edit it or change its layout, delete it, download as a pdf, or print and share it.
      Additionally, you can click the flashiphy button to make the bullet points into flashcards. With the third feature of flashcards, you can download pre-existing online or make your own. The Flashcards are also downloadable to print or share.
      This is a useful tool for revision and memorization.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the Organizer feature is an organization tool that can be used to make a mind map, a to-do list, or an org-chart, this feature is ideal for teamwork as you can set objectives and see what your team mates are doing.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Tools and techologies</h4>
    <p>The Tools and technologies required in order to make a web and software application would be programming languages such as
    <ul>
      <li> HTML which handles the text</li>
      <li> CSS is the colour and design elements</li>
      <li> lastly JavaScript which is used for the animations For the ide Atom would be used as a text editor, file manager, compiler and a translator.</li>
    </ul>

    Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop would be used for the design of the user interface components. Another language that could be used is Java which is an object-oriented programming language that supports web and desktop (Windows) applications, it
    is also compatible for Android applications.
    </p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Skills Required</h4>
    <p>To make the application, experience with the programming languages: Java, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript would be needed. Furthermore, knowledge of the IDE Atom would be essential to be able to use the languages listed. Additionally, the general
      ability to be able to find (google) the solution to a roadblock. In the case of not having these skills, it is quite easy to find the skills and software simply Google Atom or the programming languages. However, to learn them, I would recommend
      online recourses such as YouTube, Udemy, or W3Schools.</p>
    <hr><br>
    <h4>Outcome</h4>
    <p>In the case of the project being successful, it would have immensely improved the memorisation and organization for students around the world. By, providing its users with the Pomodoro method to aid the effectiveness of their studying.
      Additionally, the implementation of the Cornell Note-taking system which would aid with more organised notes and the reduction of editing. Consequently, The application could improve the average passing rate of students and their ability to
      retain the information.</p>
