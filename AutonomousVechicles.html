    <h2>What does it do?</h2>

    <p>The autonomous vehicle has been in the imaginations of people since time immemorial. Wired.com draws an evolutionary timeline of conception starting with Leonardo da Vinici’a self-propelled cart circa 1500AD:</p>

    <br><br>
    <p>The first modern and practical application of autonomous vehicle begins in 1868 with the development of the torpedo and moved through familiar technologies in aircraft autopilot, car cruise control and the goal today being a fully autonomous
      vehicle.<br><br>
      There are 5 stages of autonomy that range from assist – such as cruise control – to level 5 at full autonomy. Full autonomy would be an entirely self-sufficient vehicle that responds to instruction, but human intervention is not required under
      any condition.<br><br>
      Currently the state of the art technology must reside in self-driving vehicles, with the possible exception of undisclosed military developments.<br><br>
      There are 4 major technologies employed in modern automated vehicles, although they are all currently at stage 4 at best, and not truly fully autonomous yet:

    <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
    <p>There are more than just cars for autonomous driving. When autonomous vehicles become ubiquitous the world will look very different.<br><br>
      Drones will play a major role. Postal and delivery services may belong to Uber and Amazon from the incumbents of today and the last millennia. A delivery address for a product ordered online will lead a drone carrier to the destination.
      Initially by GPS and then by smart cameras to arrive at the door (or window). Touch screens can record a signature and the drone will return for the next run or charge. Taxi services may become fully automated sooner rather than later due to
      contact worries in the pandemic world. A driverless vehicle will pick up the passenger and run routes 24/7 earning the owner money and decentralising the transport industry. The same is true for trucks and shipping as rest stops are not
      required and efficiency per vehicle can be massively increased.
    </p>
    <p>Any time a product, package, or person is moved, this will be done by automated vehicles large and small. <br><br>
      The impact on efficiency will be massive. As will the impact on employment for these roles. However, automation is not a new invention:

    <p>Using data from the USA as a developed nation, the rise of automation is most clearly seen in the decline of agriculture over the last 150 years. There are political factors as well and many of these industry examples, but in 1850 about 55% of
      people in the US were in the agricultural industry. By 1950 that was down to about 10% due to combine harvesters and other machinery. It’s almost negligible today. What’s important to note as a comparison with automated vehicles is that
      unemployment levels didn’t skyrocket as people moved into other industries and made their labour and expertise available there.</p>

    <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
    <p>For me personally, as a health care worker, my livelihood only stands to gain efficiency from autonomous vehicles. There are already automated vehicles in hospitals and have been for an incredibly long time in the form of canisters that
      transport samples and medicines through pneumatic tubes. <br><br>
      What will affect me though, is the ease of transport and cost savings in the efficiency of delivery of goods. Ultimately, a utopian idea of personal transport could be the elimination of personal vehicles. Publicly owned and maintained ‘pods’
      could be called to the home with a voice command or other signal. The pod is powered by solar energy drawn from the roadway it uses. Entirely automatic with sensors and broadcasts to other pods it can detect road hazards and coordinate with
      other pods. Traffic lights would be elimated by the smoothly timed passing at intersections. There are no more car parks as the pod moves on to another user when the journey is complete.<br><br>
      Scale this ‘pod’ idea across any industry that moves. Which, is all of them. Small robots moving medicines from the shelf in the pharmacy to the patient’s bedside. Trucks, aircraft and ocean ships can move freely 24/7 for their mechanical life
      time never turning off. Nano robots could drift over crops of our food supply and congregate to form a mass to chase off birds, or form a barrier to mice. <br><br>
      Automation has been around for a long, long time and it is still ever so much in it’s infancy. Technology has been increasing at an exponential rate since the dawn of human beings and in the future physical machines will pair up with software
      to complete the tasks assigned to them.<br><br>
